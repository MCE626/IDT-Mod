## Submitting Bug Report
Well, you can use the issues tab on this GitHub. If you don't want to make an account, there is a BitBucket repo where you can report a bug anonymously, without creating an account. Describe the bug, and if you can take a screenshot, that might also help. Also crash logs will be 100% more helpful.

## Suggesting a New Feature
Well you can pretty much ask me anywhere you can message me.

## Setting up Development Environment
I'll get to this later. Probably will be a video.
